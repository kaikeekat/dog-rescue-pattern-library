The buttons use the Primary colour to create important contrast and emphasize the button.

- The regular buttons are for simple and direct actions, and should be used to create focus and emphasize the importance of the button's function.
- The light buttons are for smaller sections where the content is not the main focus of the page, but should be easily visible in its section.
- The ghost button should only be used when the function of the button is not of great importance to the page.
